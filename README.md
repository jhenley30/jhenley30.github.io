# CSS

Today I finished working through an HTML tutorial and a few corresponding small projects.  I've moved on to the next course using CSS.  This project website that I am developing is a part of that CSS tutorial.  I'm enjoying these sections very much and finding that I'm gaining more traction each day.  I am currently working through the course but also trying to work on a few independent projects to incorporate all of what I have learned with what I continue to learn in an effort to have a big picture perspective on developing a project and not getting overly focused on one thing.  An example being when I was working on learning JavaScript I wasn't using git hub amongst other things.  Having rerouted a bit I'm finding it easier to retain more material slowly working all of the steps on all of these different tools.  I'm enjoying this learning process very much.
